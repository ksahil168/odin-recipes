    <h2 align="center">What is Aloo Ka Paratha</h2>
    <p>
     Aloo means “potato” and paratha means “flatbread” in Hindi, so the name is quite telling: aloo paratha is an unleavened whole wheat flatbread stuffed with a savory, spiced, mashed potato filling.
     Hailing from Punjab, India, this is one of my favorite breakfasts of all time! It also happens to be one of the first recipes I learned from my Punjabi mother-in-law, so it holds a special place in my heart.
     In Punjabi families, parathas are made with lots of love and affection, not to mention lots of ghee and homemade butter (makhan). If you lean towards a healthier lifestyle, you can easily opt to roast aloo paratha in oil and serve them with curd (plain yogurt) instead of butter.
     In this post, I’ll show you two different methods of rolling the potato parathas. There’s no need to be intimidated; this recipe is really quite simple!

    <h1 align="center">How to make Aloo Paratha</h1>
      <p>Before you can make these delicious stuffed parathas, you need to prepare the potato stuffing and make the whole wheat dough.</p>
    <h3>Make Potato Stuffing</h3>
    <strong> First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
   <i><b>For cooking in a pressure cooker -</b>On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>For cooking in a pan –</b>Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</i>
