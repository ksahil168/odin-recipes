        <p> This Punjabi Chana Masala, also known as Chole Masala, 
          is an authentic North Indian style curry made with white chickpeas, freshly powdered spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs. 
          Naturally vegan and packed with healthy minerals, protein and fiber, 
          this delicious vegetarian meal can be ready in just 45 minutes minus the soaking time of chickpeas.</p>
        
        <h1>How to make Chana Masala</h1>
        <p>This simple chole masala can be broken down into three easy steps.</p>
        
        <h2>Soak and Cook Chickpeas</h2>
        <p>1. Rinse 1 cup dried white chickpeas (a.k.a. chana or chole) in fresh water a couple of times. Then soak them overnight or for 8 to 9 hours in 3 cups of water.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind to add enough water to take into account that the chickpeas increase in size during soaking.</p>
        <p>2. Traditionally dried amla (Indian gooseberries) are added to impart a dark color to the chickpeas. Amla also gives a faint sourness to the stock. If you do not have dried amla, you can opt to add 1 black tea bag.</p>
        <p>If you do not care about the dark color, then you can also just cook the chickpeas with salt and water, or opt to use drained canned chickpeas instead.</p>
        <p>3. In a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker, add the chickpeas along with 2 to 3 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Add 2.5 to 3 cups of water.</p>
        <p>4. Season with ½ teaspoon salt. Stir very well.</p>
        <p>5. Pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles on medium heat. The chickpeas should be cooked well and softened enough that you can mash them with a spoon.</p>
        
        <h1>Make Chole Masala Powder</h1>
        <p>6. Meanwhile, add all the whole spices for the chole masala to a pan or skillet. Begin to roast them on a low heat. The spices used for masala are the following:</p>
        <li>2 black cardamoms</li>
        <li> 1 inch cinnamon</li>
        <li> 3 to 4 peppercorns</li>
        <li> 2 cloves</li>
        <li> 1 medium tej patta (Indian bay leaf) or 2 small tej patta</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
